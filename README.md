## Karl Friston: Neuroscience and the Free Energy Principle

### Living System

A beautiful discussion regarding the difference between living system and existing system.  

An oil drop on the surface of water can be seen as an existing system. It has its internal part,
external part, and a sort of surface between them. It can maintain its shape and move under certain conditions.  

So what actually separate an oil drop from a tadpole?

The key is movement. An oil drop can indeed move, but the movement is driven by external states. 
Whereas a tadpole can deliberately move, which is driven by its internal states. 

### Consciousness

Given the above discussion on Living system, is it possible to define consciousness using the same framework?

We can argue that a virus has an agency in the way that it selectively finds hosts/cells to live in and move around.
However, we wouldn't say that it does so purposefully, with any sort of planning in mind.

On the other hand, an ant is definitely more conscious than a virus. It can communicate with other ants
about the information, paths, etc. It has another level of autonomy.

So, can we draw a line between conscious and non-conscious system? 
It needs to have the ability to plan for the future. To do so, it needs to have the notion of future status.
