This repository is to capture some notes/thoughts while listening to Lex Fridman's AI podcast.

## Karl Friston: Neuroscience and the Free Energy Principle

### Living System
A beautiful discussion regarding the difference between living system and existing system.  

An oil drop on the surface of water can be seen as an existing system. It has its internal part,
external part, and a sort of surface between them. It can maintain its shape and move under certain conditions.  

So what actually separate an oil drop from a tadpole?

The key is movement. An oil drop can indeed move, but the movement is driven by external states. 
Whereas a tadpole can deliberately move, which is driven by its internal states. 

### Consciousness
Given the above discussion on Living system, is it possible to define consciousness using the same framework?

We can argue that a virus has an agency in the way that it selectively finds hosts/cells to live in and move around.
However, we wouldn't say that it does so purposefully, with any sort of planning in mind.

On the other hand, an ant is definitely more conscious than a virus. It can communicate with other ants
about the information, paths, etc. It has another level of autonomy.

So, can we draw a line between conscious and non-conscious system? 
It needs to have the ability to plan for the future. To do so, it needs to have the notion of future status.

### Self-awareness
Self-awareness can be seen as an advanced level of consciousness.

It happened in evolution most likely because of the need of collaboration with other similar systems.
A human needs to know it's himself talking, not others, if he needs to communicate with other humans.

### Father and immigration
An interesting discussion between Lex Fridman and his father. 

They talked about lots of things. One topic which may touch the heart of many immigrants is that Lex said it was very 
difficult for him when his family immigrated from Russia to US. He also said that he never felt personally very close to his father. 

From his father's perspective, the move to US meant lots of new opportunities for his family and was certainly a big deal. 
However, for him personally, it just meant a big culture shift, and he lost his close friends. He was probably in Middle 
school or Elementary school. He described that it was like his father only focused on building the boat or make the boat
bigger, but not so much interested in the feelings of the people living in the boat.

Lex asked his father whether this is a Russian thing. His father said that it was not a Russian thing, but more of a Jewish 
or Immigrant thing. He said that he was always very careful in his life. He sees a lot of dangers, and he was always worried that
if one thing does not go well, everything will just crash.

### The meaning of life
Alexandre F. said that the meaning of life is to enjoy today and to be prepared for tomorrow.

Every new type of Technology creates an Arms race.

It's harder to measure happiness than to measure comfort. Industrial revolution is to increase comfort.
