### Living System

A beautiful discussion regarding the difference between living system and existing system.  

An oil drop on the surface of water can be seen as an existing system. It has its internal part,
external part, and a sort of surface between them. It can maintain its shape and move under certain conditions.  

So what actually separate an oil drop from a tadpole?

The key is movement. An oil drop can indeed move, but the movement is driven by external states. 
Whereas a tadpole can deliberately move, which is driven by its internal states.
